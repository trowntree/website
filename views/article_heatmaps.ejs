    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6" style="color: rgb(31,31,31);">
      Heatmaps - Visualising Mini-Grid Portfolio Performance
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Solar mini-grids have become one of the primary solutions for expanding electricity access in unconnected rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other emerging markets. Today, a variety of developers construct and operate mini-grids, and the metrics to take the pulse of their portfolios are largely agreed upon across the sector. Indicators such as the number of active customers, energy consumption and average consumption per user (ACPU), revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU), technical and non-technical losses, and system uptime form a common language for stakeholders in the energy access sector.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      In contrast to the broad consensus on which metrics matter, less attention is paid to how these metrics are visualised - both internally for the benefit of operational teams, as well as externally for investors, regulatory bodies and governments. Insights from behavioural science, however, show that the way information is presented has a significant impact on how it is perceived and, ultimately, how people act. Ineffectively designed visualisations can cause confusion, misunderstanding, or even distrust - especially among viewers with low graphical literacy [1]. In seeking improvements in the operational effectiveness of mini-grid operators, how can we best present the available data to help teams quickly identify issues and prioritise actions across their portfolio of mini-grids?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      The Importance of Data Presentation – The ‘Paceometer’
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      To illustrate the importance of how data is presented, consider an example (figure 1). The figure shows a ‘paceometer’ [2]. On the inner ring of numbers, you’ll see a familiar miles-per-hour indication, representing the distance travelled per unit of time. On the outer ring, however, there is a more unconventional but mathematically equivalent representation. The fraction is flipped, showing units of time per distance travelled - in this case, ‘minutes per 10 miles’.
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_1_pace_2.png" alt="Paceometer: Comparing speed and pace" class="mx-auto w-4/5">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">Figure 1 – The ‘Paceometer’: Comparing Speed (distance/time) with Pace (time/distance) [2]</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This perspective shows that accelerating 10 mph at low speeds yields substantial time savings. For instance, increasing speed from 10 to 20 mph saves you 30 minutes over 10 miles. On the other hand, the same 10 mph increase at a speed of 70 mph barely saves you a minute. Meanwhile, risks such as accident probability and accident severity increase exponentially. The paceometer clearly says: going fast is a good idea, going very fast is a fool’s game. Flooring it on the highway to make up a few minutes for a meeting is a largely futile – and potentially dangerous – endeavor.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      By presenting the same information differently, a new story surfaces. It is likely that, were cars equipped with ‘paceometers’ rather than speedometers, lives would be saved each year as a result of drivers naturally moderating speed. Clearly, the way visualisation conveys information matters, and small changes can dramatically shape perception and behavior.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Introducing Heatmaps for Actionable Mini-Grid Insights
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Effective visualisation begins with a clear understanding of the intended users. In this case, these are operational teams, who use data to prioritise operations & maintenance (O&M) actions. At the same time, stakeholders such as investors, regulators and governments rely on the data to monitor investment performance and energy access progress. The greatest value of a well-designed interface with data lies with the first group - the operators themselves, who have the shortest feedback loop between data and action.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Heatmaps are simply a reorganised view of the data that these teams are likely looking at already. It builds on time-averaging of metrics and showing performance differences within, as well as between, mini-grid sites in one view.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      They can be made for any metric - energy consumption, ACPU, ARPU and so on, provided the data is available to the operator (which can be a challenge in its own right). Drawing on the example of the ‘paceometer’ above, the objective is to create a visualisation that conveys, at a glance, the information needed to guide effective action. It should make it immediately clear to operational teams where attention and resources are most urgently required.
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_2_energy_consumption.png" alt="Heatmap of energy consumption" class="mx-auto">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Figure 2 – An example heatmap, for visualising the ‘energy consumption’ metric over a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. It is coloured in a row-based way to highlight changes within sites.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The heatmap coloring can be applied in two ways. Row-based coloring is useful to highlight changes within a single mini-grid over time - for example, metrics like active customers or energy consumption. Global coloring across the entire sheet is better when you want to compare a metric between mini-grids. The example in the figure is coloured per row, to put the emphasis on how the energy consumption metric fluctuates over time for a mini-grid. It is true that you would still see within-row colour differences if the sheet is coloured globally, but it would primarily highlight consumption differences between mini-grids, which is driven largely by different installed PV capacities, rather than mini-grid performance.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Naturally, green colours indicate a desirable direction for the metric (e.g., high values for active customers or consumption, low values for things like technical losses), while a red colour shows where the metric is at its low point. It is a pointer towards sites that require operational resources.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">Using Heatmaps</h3>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Observation 1 - A mini-grid that is completely offline:</strong> Mini-grid 1 (MG-01, first row) during weeks T-8 to T-10 illustrates what a full system shutdown looks like. Energy consumption drops to zero and the cells turn red, calling for operator action. It also shows how much energy sales is being lost per day of downtime, useful for prioritisation.</li>
      <li><strong>Observation 2 - A mini-grid operating at reduced capacity:</strong> MG-04 and MG-12 indicate reduced energy consumption in weeks T-7 and T-8. Such a pattern suggests a fault in a portion of the system, like a distribution branch failure, inverter issue, or partial generation fault.</li>
      <li><strong>Observation 3 - Gradual performance degradation over the portfolio:</strong> In dusty environments, insufficient panel cleaning can result in a slow, steady decline in energy production. The trend appears as the gradual color shift over several weeks (columns T-5 to T-2).</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Heatmaps for different metrics, however, can reveal different aspects of mini-grid performance. Consider, for instance, a heatmap of energy losses (%), a metric that tracks the proportion of energy injected into a grid but not sold (figure 3).
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_3_energy_losses.png" alt="Heatmap of energy losses" class="mx-auto">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Figure 3 – An example heatmap, for visualising the ‘energy losses’ metric over a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. It is coloured globally to highlight changes between sites.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mb-6">
      A heatmap based on capacity utilisation - comparing energy sold to the theoretically available energy for sales - can highlight sites operating below their potential (Figure 4).
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_4_cap.png" alt="Heatmap of capacity utilisation" class="mx-auto">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Figure 4 – An example heatmap, for visualising the ‘capacity utilisation’ metric over a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. It is coloured globally to highlight changes between sites.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Observation 4 - Excessive energy losses:</strong> MG-13 shows consistently elevated losses from weeks T-1 to T-7. An operational team would be dispatched to diagnose and resolve the issue. Losses return to ‘normal’ in the latest week of the map.</li>
      <li><strong>Observation 5 - Mini-grids operating below potential:</strong> MG-09 and MG-14 stand out for capacity utilisations in the 50-60% range. This view can trigger operations teams to explore further PUE integration or install digital loads (micro data centres, cryptocurrency mining) to monetise available energy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Beyond the examples above, heatmaps of other metrics can reveal additional insights. A few more examples:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Active Customers:</strong> Identify clusters of offline customers even if total grid consumption remains stable.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenues:</strong> Compare earnings between sites to help prioritise operational backlogs.</li>
      <li><strong>PUE performance:</strong> Metrics like leasing fees, e-bike swaps, or energy usage can reveal underperforming or high-potential sites.</li>
      <li><strong>Powerhouse temperature:</strong> Spot HVAC anomalies to prolong BESS lifetime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Creating & Using Heatmaps in Your Organisation
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Heatmaps should be relatively straightforward for most operators to make. In their simplest form, they can be a coloured Excel sheet built from processed data. The key prerequisite is a functioning data pipeline - from smart-meter to central data warehouse.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Basic implementation:</strong> Scripted extraction from the database generating manual Excel heatmaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate implementation:</strong> Automated generation embedded in dashboards or internal tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced implementation:</strong> Automated heatmaps with alerts notifying teams immediately of anomalies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Operators can embed heatmaps directly into routines, establishing a continuous feedback loop between data and action. Aligning discussions with the heatmap resolution (e.g., weekly) helps maintain focus.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Heatmaps are straightforward to integrate into workflows. Complex metrics are reduced to simple color cues: green indicates optimal performance, red signals issues, and gradients reveal trends over time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The way energy access data is presented greatly affects operational effectiveness. Heatmaps offer an intuitive way to monitor mini-grid portfolios and distributed energy assets. They condense complex data into a glanceable view, highlighting anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Heatmaps rely on data most mini-grid operators already collect. Their primary value is with operators, but they also provide coherent reporting for investors, regulators, and governments.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Well-designed visualisations alone do not guarantee operational success, but they are critical in building capable, responsive operators and resilient businesses. By making complex information easily interpretable, heatmaps enable faster, informed decisions, improving performance and advancing universal electricity access.
    </p>
