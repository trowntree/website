    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2" style="color: rgb(31,31,31);">
      Heatmaps - Visualising Mini-Grid Portfolio Performance
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Solar mini-grids have become one of the primary solutions for expanding electricity access in unconnected rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other emerging markets. Today, a variety of developers construct and operate mini-grids, and the metrics to take the pulse of their portfolios are largely agreed upon across the sector. Indicators such as the number of active customers, energy consumption and average consumption per user (ACPU), revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU), technical and non-technical losses, and system uptime form a common language for stakeholders in the energy access sector.      
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      In contrast to the broad consensus on <em>which</em> metrics matter, less attention is paid to <em>how</em> these metrics are visualised - both internally for the benefit of operational teams, as well as externally for investors, regulatory bodies and governments. Insights from behavioural science, however, show that the way information is presented has a significant impact on how it is perceived and, ultimately, how people act. Ineffectively designed visualisations can cause confusion, misunderstanding, or even distrust - especially among viewers with low graphical literacy [1]. In seeking improvements in the operational effectiveness of mini-grid operators, how can we best present the available data to help teams quickly identify issues and prioritise actions across their portfolio of mini-grids?     
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      The Importance of Data Presentation – The ‘Paceometer’
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      To illustrate the importance of how data is presented, consider an example (figure 1). The figure shows a ‘paceometer’ [2]. On the inner ring of numbers, you’ll see a familiar miles-per-hour indication, representing the distance travelled per unit of time. On the outer ring, however, there is a more unconventional <em>but mathematically equivalent</em> representation. The fraction is flipped, showing units of time per distance travelled - in this case, ‘minutes per 10 miles’.     
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_1_pace_2.png" alt="Paceometer: Comparing speed and pace" class="mx-auto w-3/5">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">Figure 1 – The ‘Paceometer’: Comparing Speed (distance/time) with Pace (time/distance) [2]</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This perspective shows that accelerating 10 mph at low speeds yields substantial time savings. For instance, increasing speed from 10 to 20 mph saves you 30 minutues over a distance of 10 miles. On the other hand, the same 10 mph increase at a speed of 70 mph barely saves you a minute. Meanwhile, risks such as accident probability and accident severity increase exponentially. The paceometer clearly says: going fast is a good idea, going very fast is a fools game. Flooring it on the highway to make up a few minutes for a meeting is a largely futile – and potentially dangerous - endeavor.     
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      By presenting the same information differently, a new story surfaces. It is likey that, were cars equiped with ‘paceometers’ rather than speedometers, lives would be saved each year as a result of drivers naturally moderating speed. Clearly, the way visualisation by which information is conveys matters, and small changes can dramatically shape perception and behavior.     
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6"></p>
      The example raises an important question: are we getting the presentation of our energy access metrics right and how do we design data interfaces that deliver the most actionable insights? 
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Introducing Heatmaps for Actionable Mini-Grid Insights
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Effective visualisation begins with a clear understanding of the intended users. In this case, these are operational teams, who use data to priortise operations & maintenance (O&M) actions. At the same time, stakeholders such as investors, regulators and governments, rely on the data to monitor investment performance and energy access progress. The greatest value of a well-designed interface with data lies with the first group - the operators themselves, wo have the shortest feedback loop between data and action.     
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Heatmaps are simply a reorganised view of the data that these teams are likely looking at already. It builds on time-averaging of metrics and showing performance differences within, as well as between, mini-grid sites in one view.     
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      They can be made for any metric - energy consumption, ACPU, ARPU and so on, provided the data is available to the operator (which can be a challenge in its own right). Drawing on the example of the ‘paceometer’ above, the objective is to create a visualisation that conveys, at a glance, the information needed to guide effective action. It should make it immediately clear to operational teams where attention and resources are most urgently required.    
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Figure 2 shows an example heatmap for <em>energy consumption</em> of a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. Each cell represents the average value of that metric (over the last week) for a given mini-grid (rows) at a particular point in time (columns). In this case it would show the average daily energy consumption (in kWh’s) for the week in question. The time-resolution can be adjusted to suit the operator’s needs – this example uses weekly averages, but daily or monthly columns could work too. More recent dates are shown towards the left of the map, older ones to the right. 
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_2_energy_consumption_HD.png" alt="Heatmap of energy consumption" class="mx-auto w-5/5">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">Figure 2 – An example heatmap, for visualising the ‘energy consumption’ metric over a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. It is coloured in a row-based way to highlight changes within sites.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The heatmap coloring can be applied in two ways. <em>Row-based</em> coloring is useful to highlight changes <em>within</em> a single mini-grid over time - for example, metrics like active customers or energy consumption. <em>Global coloring</em> across the entire sheet is better when you want to compare a metric <em>between</em> mini-grids. The example in the figure is coloured per row, to put the emphasis on how the energy consumption metric fluctuates over time for a mini-grid. It is true that you would still see within-row colour differences if the sheet is coloured globally, but it would primarily highlight consumption differences between mini-grids, which is driven laregely by different installed PV capacities, rather than mini-grid performance.     
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Naturally, green colours indicate a desirable direction for the metric (e.g., high values for active customers or consumption, low values for things like technical losses), while a red colour shows where the metric is at it’s lowpoint. It is a pointer towards sites that require operational resources.     
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Using Heatmaps
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
    From the <em>energy consumption</em> heatmap (figure 2), several typical events become immediately visible:
    </p> 

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Observation 1 - A mini-grid that is completely offline:</strong><br>
        Mini-grid 1 (MG-01, first row) during weeks T-8 to T-10 illustrates what a full system shutdown looks like. Energy consumption drops to zero and the cells turn red, calling for operator action. In addition to showing that the mini-grid is offline, it is also clear how much energy sales is being lost per day of downtime, which can be useful input in the prioritisation of outstanding issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Observation 2 - A mini-grid operating at reduced capacity:</strong><br>
        MG-04 and MG-12 indicate reduced energy consumption in weeks T-7 and T-8. Such a pattern suggests a fault in a portion of the system. It could originate from a multitude of things, for instance a failure in one of the distribution grid branches, the loss of a battery inverter, or failure of a portion of the energy generation system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Observation 3 - Gradual performance degradation over the portfolio:</strong><br>
        In dusty environments, insufficient panel cleaning can result in a slow, steady decline in energy production. While less obvious than sudden failures, the trend appears as the gradual color shift over several weeks, see an example in columns week T-5 to week T-2.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The examples above are insights that can be gained from of a heatmap for energy consumption. Heatmaps for different metrics, however, can reveal different aspects of mini-grid performance. Consider, for instance, a heatmap of <em>energy losses</em> (%), a metric that tracks the proportion of energy that is injected into a grid, but not sold (figure 3). 
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_3_energy_losses_HD.png" alt="Heatmap of energy losses" class="mx-auto w-5/5">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">Figure 3 – An example heatmap, for visualising the ‘energy losses’ metric over a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. It is coloured globally to highlight changes between sites.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Observation 4 - Excessive energy losses:</strong> MMG-13 shows consistently elevated losses from weeks T-1 to T-7. An operational team would be dispatched to diagnose and resolve the issue. Losses return to ‘normal’ in the latest week of the map.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      A heatmap based on <em>capacity utilisation</em> - comparing energy sold to the theoretically available energy for sales - can highlight sites operating below their potential (Figure 4).
    </p>

    <figure class="mb-6">
      <img src="images/IMG_4_cap_HD.png" alt="Heatmap of capacity utilisation" class="mx-auto">
      <figcaption class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">
        Figure 4 – Example heatmap visualising the ‘capacity utilisation’ metric across a portfolio of 15 mini-grids. The colour scale is applied globally to emphasise differences between sites.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
      <li><strong>Observation 5 - Mini-grids that are operating below their potential</strong> The heatmap highlights which sites are operating below capacity. In the example, MG-09 and MG-14 stand out for capacity utilisations in the 50-60% range. This view can trigger operations teams to explore further PUE integration or the installation of digital loads (e.g., micro data centres, cryptocurrency ming) to monetise the available energy. </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
    Beyond the examples above, heatmaps of other metrics can reveal additional insights. A few more examples: 
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Active Customers:</strong><br>
        A heatmap of <em>active customers</em> makes it possible to identify clusters of customers going offline within a mini-grid. It functions similarly to Observation 1 (energy consumption) above, but is slightly more sensitive: total grid consumption may remain stable even if 10–20 individual customers are disconnected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revenues:</strong><br>
        A heatmap for portfolio <em>revenues</em> can be useful. Knowledge of relative earnings between sites is important information in the prioritisation of the backlog of operational issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PUE performance:</strong><br>
        Displaying PUE-related metrics—such as leasing fees, e-bike battery swaps, or PUE energy usage (when recorded separately)—in a heatmap format can highlight underperforming or high-potential sites, supporting more targeted commercial and operational decisions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Powerhouse temperature:</strong><br>
        Tracking <em>powerhouse temperatures</em> can help spot anomalies in the HVAC systems in powerhouses, prolonging the useful lifetime of the BESS.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6"></p>
     Many other metrics can be visualised in this way. It is ultimately up to operators to select and design heatmaps that best support their operational practices. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Implementing Heatmaps in Your Organisation
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Heatmaps should be relatively straightforward for most operators to make. In their most simple form, they can be a simple, coloured, excel sheet built from processed data. The key prerequisite is a functioning data pipeline - from customer smart-meter to a central data warehouse - which, in many mini-grid contexts, is a challenge in itself. We may define increasing levels of implementation:   
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Basic implementation:</strong><br>
        A basic script that takes an extract from the database and generates the heatmaps. At this level, the output may simply be a colour-coded Excel file, reviewed manually.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intermediate implementation:</strong><br>
        Automated generation of heatmaps, embedded within the operator’s digital ecosystem (dashboards or internal tools).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advanced implementation:</strong><br>
        Automated heatmaps combined with alerts that flag notable changes in key metrics from one day or week to the next. Operating teams are then immediately notified in case of anomalies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Operators could aim to embed the use heatmaps directly into their operational routines, using them to establish a continuous feedback loop between data and action. A practical starting point is to align discussions with the resolution of the heatmap itsels (so for example weekly, if the columns of the map is at week-level resolution). By using heatmaps, interpreting metrics is reduced to reading color cues: green indicates optimal performance, red signals issues, and gradients reveal trends over time.    
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1" style="color: rgb(81,230,0);">
      Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The way we present data energy access matters a great deal in the ability of operational teams to use them effective for mini-grid operations and maintenance. Heatmaps can be an intuitive way to take the pulse of a mini-grid portfolio or any other set of distributed energy assets. They condense operational data into a single, glanceable view, and help spot anomalies that might otherwise remain hidden.    
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Heatmaps build on data that most mini-grid operators are already collecting in one form or another. Their primary value lies with operational teams, who are best positioned to act on the revealed insights. At the same time, the same visualisations can serve as a coherent and transparent reporting format for external stakeholders such as investors, regulators, and governments.    
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Well-designed data visualisations by themselves are not enough to ensure operational success. However, they are a critical component in building capable, responsive operators and resilient businesses. By making complex information more easily interpretable, and therefore actionable, they enable faster, more informed decisions, helping drive better performance and bring universal electricity access closer to reality.
